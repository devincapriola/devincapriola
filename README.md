# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Devin Capriola

## About Me
Iâ€™m a high school junior graduating a year early with a strong focus on artificial intelligence, automation, and software development. Over the past four years, Iâ€™ve built a deep foundation in coding and problem-solving through hands-on projects and continuous learning. Iâ€™ve completed over 90 certifications on Udemy, covering everything from AI and machine learning to full-stack development and cloud automation.

Iâ€™m passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems and eager to connect with others in the tech space who are driven by innovation. Whether itâ€™s collaborating on projects or exploring new opportunities, Iâ€™m always open to meaningful conversations and impactful work.
